# SolarNetâ€‘Plus (Rooftop & Superstructure Segmentation)

**A reproduction and adaptation of SolarNet+ for rooftop footprint & superstructure extraction only**  
*(solar potential calculation module **not included**) *

---

## Overview

This repository contains my **adapted implementation** of the **SolarNet+** framework (from the official paper and GitHub) focused on **roof footprint and superstructure semantic segmentation** using the RID dataset.

While the original SolarNet+ includes solar potential estimation, I reproduced the parts dealing with:
- **Roof segmentation** (classifying building roof vs. background)
- **Roof superstructures segmentation** (e.g., chimneys, skylights, HVAC units)

I **did not implement** the solar potential calculation pipeline.


## What I Did

- **Dataset preparation**  
  - Used the official RID dataset (roof + superstructure annotations) from the original SolarNet+ repo.  
  - **Refactored** and **aligned** image-mask pairs to match model input (e.g. resizing, organizing channels).

- **Code adaptation & training**  
  - Modified `transolarnet.py` and training pipeline to run on my computing environment.  
  - Ensured compatibility (e.g. label channels, class counts, input-output paths).

- **Inference pipeline**  
  - Validated predictions on both **patch-based** and **full-image** workflows (`predict_patch.py` & `predict_tif.py`).

- **Logging & visualization**  
  - Corrected minor bugs (file paths, label mismatches).  
  - Logged IoU metrics on segmentation.  
  - Visualized segmented roof outlines and superstructures.

## Not Implemented

- **Solar potential estimation (e.g., PV generation, azimuth/pitch inference, area-based output)**  
  - Although the original SolarNet+ repo includes `pvcode/cal_pv.py` to compute solar potential using segmentation outputs, I **did not run or customize** it.  
  - That repo focuses on the calculation of the rooftop solar potential tasks.

## How to use

-- Training:
  - Create a virtual environment and install the libraries in requirement.txt
      - pip install requirement.txt

  - clone this github repo (maintain file structure of this repo)
  - to train the model, run
      - python trainsolarnet.py
  - best weights will be stored in the checkpoint folder with name 'best.pth'

-- Prediction:
  -  to predict the test images, run
      - python predict_patch.py (here model used the best.pth(trained weights) generated during the training)
  - outputs will be in folders:
      - predictionroofsegemnt (for roof segments)
      - predictionsuperstructure (for superstructures)
      NOTE: these images are kind of binary images to view the images in proper viewable form
            - to view the results
                - go to folder 'test_set_results'
                - extract the rar file to see the results for the prediction by the model

Output maps include:

-Roof segmentation mask (7 classes which includes orientation of the roof )

-Roof superstructure mask (binary)

## Results & Highlights
Successfully reproduced roof footprint and superstructure segmentation using SolarNet+ architecture.

Achieved segmentation **IoU of 0.76** (comparable to original performance reported).

Learned how dataset alignment, mask channel structure, and class imbalance affect final results.

This experience served as a stepping stone toward implementing a more robust HRNet + OCR pipeline later.

## Why This Matters
Demonstrates ability to reproduce and adapt research-level code.

Highlights skills in data restructuring, debugging segmentation pipelines, and fine-tuning CNNs.

Sets strong foundation for building more domain-specific architectures (like HRNet pipelines).
